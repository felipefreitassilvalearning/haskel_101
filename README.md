This repository contains many projects built in Haskell, varying in difficulty. This is my first experience with the functional paradigm.
It was based on the [Programação Funcional em Haskell - Curso Completo - UFABC](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYItvall0TqJ25sVTLcMhxsE0Hci58mpQ) playlist from [ufabc_hal](https://www.youtube.com/@ufabchal) channel.
